== Description ==

Super simple but powerful widget that allows adding single or multiple images to your widget positions, using native media uploader. You can add caption for each image that will show below it, or you can use it as banner advertising module because its not being blocked with Ad Blocker. It doesnâ€™t load any javascript on front end so its super fast.
